# Handwriting_Nastaliq_Recognition_BLSTM
Handwriting Nastaliq Recognition using CNN-BDLSTM. This project detects contours in Nastaliq script, groups writing items by geometric proximity, and uses a custom dataset with a CNN-BDLSTM model for text recognition. Achieves high accuracy through data augmentation and hybrid neural networks.
